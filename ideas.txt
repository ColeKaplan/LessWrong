One file should take people's basic numbers (posts, comments, time on site, karma, amount donated)
- Do people with more posts have better average karma per post
- Do the very top posters and top commenters overlap
- Are the people with top donations also top karma
- Do the top posters still have bad posts (low or negative karma)
- Calculate H-Index for top users (highest number n of posts they have that are cited at least n times.)

Another file for clustering users based on interactions
- Should color them based on the 6 Core Concepts
- See if people mostly interact within their subdomain or not
